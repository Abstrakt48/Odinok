pretty much, raw map files will look like this:

map # map is a built in type
{
	name:"map_basic" # name is a string
	size:20 20 # size is a vec2, values seperated by a space

	objects
	{
		obj_building
		{
			position:7.5 1.5 10 # for all objects, origin is in the center by default, you can change this by declaring the origin var
			rotation:0 0 90
			scale:15 3 10
		}
	}
}
